# IonSat FlatSat Hub

This is the repository to host the Flatsat central hub. 

The most important task of the FlatSat hub, aside of routing the module's signals together, is being able of handling and dispatching power. 
    
Compared to the modules, this results in a slightly more complex card layout, albeit prettier. 
The multi-level schematic also gets more intricate.
